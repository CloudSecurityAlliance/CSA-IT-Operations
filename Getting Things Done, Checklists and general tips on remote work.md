Please note this is what works for me (Kurt Seifried) and I believe most of it will work for others, but as always one size does not fit all so try it out, and if it doesn’t work it might be because it's not quite the right fit for you (as opposed to “you’re doing it wrong”)

# TODOs

Todos should exist in both a central system (GTD) and as close to the actual place they get done (e.g. in this document).

TODO: Add Wardley Mapping section
TODO: fix the tables at the end

# GTD

**Getting Things Done** by David Allen - [https://gettingthingsdone.com/](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)

TL;DR: GTD works because it accepts the problems of the modern world and provides some solutions for dealing with them. Have hundreds of projects and todos? Have constantly evolving projects and todos? Have constantly changing priorities and emergencies that need to be dealt with? GTD offers a framework to deal with this.

GTD is not always easy, and requires effort to implement, but it also has one major advantage: you can get incremental benefits from an incremental deployment. I would say I’m not even at 50% (let alone 100%) on GTD (and the other things listed here), but because I get 50% of the benefit my life is still much saner than it otherwise would be without this.

I’m going to recap some of the critical components of GTD here. Why? Because writing things down and documenting them makes it real, and helps remind me of what I need to do and why.

**Short simple actionable advice is best.**

## Organizational systems - less is more

Having an organizational system is critical. Most of us already have access to one or more through work (e.g. Airtable, ZenDesk). Having fewer systems is better, at a minimum you’ll have to use whatever systems your job relies upon, and you need at least one system for yourself. Everyone, whether they want to or not, has projects and tasks they need to track (grocery lists, renovations, planning for trips/renovations, etc.), pretending that you don’t isn’t an option (well it is, just a messy and painful one). So my advice is to have as few systems as possible.

## Electronic vs paper - electronic

In the past I would have said I don’t care if your system is paper or electronic, as long as it works for you. Now I would say paper is obsolete for one simple reason: you can’t easily share it with others, even if you’re just cutting and pasting content into an email this is far quicker and easier then retyping paper based information (and if it’s not easy, you won’t do it, trust me). You also need to share with yourself, desktop, tablet and phone. The best computer is the one you have, so your GTD **MUST** be available on your phone. I would suggest also ensuring it works well on your tablet (for when you wanna camp on a couch), but I would also say you **MUST** have a desktop version if you want to actually do an efficient weekly review or otherwise do “heavy” work with it.

## Sharing and collaboration

Sharing seems to boil down to two scenarios:

1.  You can either directly share something (e.g. adding someone to a calendar entry) easily
    
2.  You can’t share it at all short of cutting and pasting it into an email and sending it to them (like email, OmniFocus, etc.)
    
Where possible choose electronic options that allow sharing, the good news is that this is usually the default now. In general Cloud based options either have sharing built in or can interface with iCloud/OneDrive/DropBox/etc. to share across your own devices and externally share things.

### Sharing Email

A special note on sharing email: use lists/groups where possible for recurring situations where you need to share email, also the archives allow new users to see the past email easily. Also for sharing with yourself I use the Google message URL, e.g. [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/joHohOJHHOIHUohihOLIHH](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/joHohOJHHOIHUohihOLIHH) and of course these URL’s don’t appear to work for anyone else (even someone on the email thread). This is why I prefer to actually carry discussions in systems like Airtable as opposed to email.

## Inboxes - less is more

You have to have inboxes for people to send you stuff (also see Push vs Pull) and to put your own stuff.

### Email

You have to have a personal email inbox, hopefully something that is semi professional (not stinkybutt@). You most likely also have a work related email, if you need to have multiple work related emails I would suggest forwarding stuff if possible so you have fewer inboxes to check.

You also have to process your email, not just read it. By processing I mean you have to go through it and put it into the appropriate GTD system, ideally decide what to do with it, and if it’s a 2 minute task maybe just get it done. Reading it and leaving it means there’s still work to be done (or else you would have hit archive or delete) and you just wasted time and mental effort reading and avoiding something. Do this enough and it starts to be a major time sink.

One thing I’ll do when I’m not at inbox 0 is just pick AN email and FORCE myself to deal with it, this may far as to require that I update my GTD system (e.g. create a new project to hold it, or even examine my GTD system overall if it’s weird enough). I find this helps me close the gaps in my GTD system. You’ll always have gaps because your life and work are constantly changing, growing and evolving.

### Electronic inboxes

Most of us also have to service various electronic “inboxes” such as a list of tickets assigned to us or a KanBan board with items that need working. The key here is always less is more. I personally use a checklist (not reliably) for things I need to check, and I generally ignore most of my social media inboxes.

### Phone Voicemail / Texts

You have to have a phone, which means you have voicemail and texts. The only reason to have voicemail anymore in my opinion is if you deal with people that can’t use cell phones to send you a text (for example my kids school). If possible setup your voicemail to automatically be sent as email so you don’t have to transcribe it.

### Physical mail

Don’t have a mail bathtub. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmC9AUNi2PI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmC9AUNi2PI)). Open all your mail, and at least put it in your inbox for processing later. In general any mail that you get on a regular basis (bills, legal documents) should feed into a workflow.

### A physical inbox

If you don’t have somewhere to put physical paper/things then your whole desk/office/house becomes a giant inbox (this is both a quote from David Allen, and true in my personal experience).

I would suggest putting this on your desk or next to your desk (mine is on top of my filing cabinet which is directly next to my desk).

## A filing cabinet

If you don’t have somewhere to put physical paper/things then your whole desk/office/house becomes a giant filing cabinet (this is both a quote from David Allen, and true in my personal experience).

I put stuff on top, I need to get better at keeping the top of it clear. Everything goes in alphabetical order. I have two drawers so I use one for personal stuff and one for business stuff. I used to have 4 drawers but realized I could throw a lot of stuff out or box it up (archived records). Hit that archive button just like in email!

I also have a folder at the front with Avery labels (2327) so I can reuse folders easily. I hand write my labels typically but suggest printing them from computer if you have to do a lot all at once (especially the first time you do your filing).

## Mind sweep - more than once

In GTD the idea of a mind sweep is simple: take everything in your brain and put it into your GTD system(s). In practice this is hard because we can’t always think of everything, and most of us don’t fully trust our GTD system (so I leave stuff in my inboxes and my head sometimes…). The trick I found that works best is this: Make time to do a sweep once in a while, at a desktop or laptop computer (so you can enter lots of text quickly), think about everything you need to do, create new projects, add tasks, update tasks and so on. And then make it easy to add stuff to your GTD, I use my phone with OmniFocus mostly for this, I also try to aggressively think of “anything else?” while I have the app open.

## Working with your GTD system(s)

There’s a few tricks to working with a GTD system. You’ll want to split things up into projects at a minimum, I also use folders to split my projects up into major life areas (CSA, kids, renovations, business, personal, and so on).

### Projects

A project should have some definable outcome ideally, but could also be an ongoing thing where maybe you haven’t fully defined the outcome, but you’re working on something experimental or ongoing. That’s ok. Projects quite often have more than one task, and sometimes more than one sub project. I haven’t found a good way to do dependencies, so I’ll sometimes do double entry, e.g. “fix window” in one project and “first fix window” in another project relying on the window to be fixed first (e.g. buying new blinds for it). The trick here is to leave yourself clues as to what is going on, but you don’t have to be obsessive, most things will be easily figured out with just a hint.

### Contexts

Contexts are where things happen, e.g. @computer, @home, @errands. I find I generally split them up into a few main contexts boiling down to: needs a personal computer (e.g. shopping/research), needs my work computer and authentication tokens (CSA work), needs to be at home (renovations/etc.) for example. As always less is more.

### Next Action Step

GTD says you should always define the next action step, I personally try to do this, but I don’t find it necessary for two main reasons: the task often defines the next action step itself “buy plywood” or the task itself is figuring out what comes next (I need to think about it or make a decision). I would suggest as part of your weekly reviews you try to enter next action steps where possible since you’ve already spent the mental effort getting into the task and understanding it.

## Using Airtable at the CSA

The CSA Provides a cloud based Airtable instance. I'm still learning how to use it.

# Push vs Pull - push

If you can setup a system to push you notifications I suggest you do so. The advantages of this are two fold: you have one less thing to check, and you can see how much stuff it’s pushing out and fine tune it (e.g. mute unimportant stuff, adjust what gets pushed, etc.). It’s also easier to involve others and share it.

## Calendars

Writing it down makes it real. Putting it in the calendar makes it real for that time, these are the definite things that you have to do at that time (e.g. meetings with others). I also use my calendars extensively to remind me of recurring things (car oil change, review CSA accounts, etc.) and have it send me an email saying to do so with a link to documentation or a checklist in the email (don’t make yourself go look for it, push it to yourself).

### Accepting/Declining/Maybe calendar invites

See making agreements. If someone schedules a meeting and invites you I strongly suggest marking your “Yes/No/Maybe”, it’s polite, but it also encourages you to think about whether or not this is something you really need to do or not and to potentially renegotiate the calendar event if needed. It’s also incredibly helpful on the receiving end to know if people are planning to come or not, also if a lot of people say no then it’s an indication you may need to change the meeting time/etc.

### Punctuality

See making agreements. Be punctual. It makes you predictable and easy to deal with. If you can’t be punctual renegotiate/inform the other party as soon as possible. Having said that 1 minute of warning is still better than no warning. See also “Making agreements.”

## Lists

Lists and Checklists are different but similar. Both are actionable items (“check fuel valve, check fuel tank”, “milk, eggs, bread”) and I’m not sure how to exactly explain the difference but I think there is one (I could also be wrong). Use an electronic shared list system, even just plain text works fine here, things like groceries, packing for a trip and so on should all be written down, most lists get re-used, a lot (something else they have in common with checklists).

## Note taking

You need a place to talk quick notes, write down a sentence or three, store some URL’s about an idea for an article. I suggest you pick a note taking app that works across all your devices so if you have a random thought somewhere you can note it down quickly.

I used to use Apples built in notes app but now that I also use Windows 10 I’ve switched to Microsoft One Note.

## Documentation - write it down

Writing it down makes it real. That’s all I have to say here. Less is more. This document is already to long but I'm not a good enough writer to make it more concise without a lot of effort.

# Checklists - use them

**The Checklist Manifesto** by Atul Gawande [http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) Also a good summary here: [https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/)

Writing it down makes it real. It lets you and others know what is actually expected, what the assumptions are. Consistency means you can more easily detect problems with the checklist and fix it.

# Password management

Use a password manager with a web browser plugin:

1.  You can’t remember all your passwords - your password manager can
    
2.  You can’t create great passwords - your password manager can
    
3.  You can’t reliably tell if you’re entering your password into the correct site - your password manager can
    
4.  You can’t easily reset your passwords - your password manager can (sometimes)
    
5.  You can’t easily share a password or back them up if they’re in your head - your password manager can
    
Good news: Google Android/Chrome have a good built in password manager [https://passwords.google.com/](https://passwords.google.com/)

Apple iOS/MacOS/Safari have a great built in password manager (“Keychain”) [https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204085](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204085)

There are lots of good/great third party alternatives that have corporates features and other management aspects.

# Making and keeping agreements

You need to make and keep agreements.

## Making agreements

People who refuse or shy away from making agreements stop getting invited to play (if someone always says “no” or “maybe I’ll try” people give up asking). People who refuse to commit to agreements (“I’ll try”) are basically saying “I don’t care enough to commit to this, I want to leave myself an out.”

## Keeping and renegotiating agreements

Here’s the thing: if you reliably make and keep agreements (90%+?) people will happily forgive you when you fail to keep one. See also punctuality (agreeing on a time is an agreement). Especially if you try to renegotiate in advance as much as possible, or at least try to warn them. 1 minute before being late is not a renegotiation BTW, but 1 minute warning and letting the person know what’s going on is better than nothing.

We all have cell phones. There is no excuse anymore to not renegotiate and warn people if needed via email, text, voice, whatever.

# Sparking Joy

**The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing** by Marie Kondo [https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308)

## Tidying/Organizing vs cleaning

I used to think tidying, organizing and cleaning were the same thing. I was wrong. You can have a cluttered but clean house. Many of us are lucky enough to have to much stuff, stuff we no longer need or use, but it takes up space and more importantly takes up our attention. Getting rid of stuff you don’t need seems like a no brainer so why is it so hard?

Simple: most organization and tidying systems boil down to “keep stuff like your socks and car keys, you need that obviously, and that pair of pants that doesn’t fit, has a hole and is super ugly throw it away (even though it has great sentimental value). All that stuff in-between? Good luck.”

Sparking Joy addresses these issues and gives you an important tool to feel ok with getting rid of or keeping stuff. Does it spark joy? I have a pair of lederhosen that I wear maybe once a year, but they have serious sentimental value, so I keep them. I got rid of a pile of computer stuff I haven’t used in ages and won’t use in ages, even though I paid good money for it, and I no longer feel like I wasted money (I mean I did, but I’ve come to terms with it). I no longer feel stressed about getting rid of or keeping stuff.

Please also note unless you live alone you might want to bounce “does it spark joy” off of your partner or children before you get rid of stuff that may spark joy for them (e.g. old scratched DVDs that are unwatchable, DO NOT THROW THOSE OUT WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION, those physical archives of their favorite shows may be really important. Or not. But you should ask first).

## Clear bins only, and labels, or really really nice boxes

Storing stuff in bins means using clear bins and labeling it, or the opposite, get a really tasteful artistic box that you’re proud to have on display in your living room. I do use some opaque storage bins but only for seasonal stuff that goes in the box for 6 months and then comes out (ski gear, bicycling gear, etc.).

Also don’t be afraid to have boxes that aren’t completely full if you have the space for it (aka you live in a house). If you live in a smaller space you’ll want to pack those boxes full.

## Applying “Does it spark joy” to work

You can also apply this to work, for example I was just cleaning up our issues tracker and realized we have a bunch of really old archived projects that clutter up reports (so I keep editing filters to ignore them) but a better solution would be to simply delete them (after exporting a backup of course). This means I no longer have to remove a dozen projects from filters when I want to track unowned issues in TODO state for example. The main caveat for applying “Does it spark joy” at work however is you need to talk to your coworkers/manager/etc, it may not spark joy for you, but it might for them.

# Working remotely

I’ve been working remotely for 20+ years. Working remotely in a time of COVID is totally different. I would have said in past that you can (should?) go to a coffee shop once in a while to work for an hour or three just to be around other people if you get a bit isolated. This is not good advice currently.

## Working remotely in a time of COVID

I’m not sure what to say here. I think being mindful of socializing (make sure you do!) and communicating clearly (since we’re missing body language and a lot of high quality face to face interaction) is beyond important now.

## Bandwidth

Hah you thought I was going to talk about your Internet. Well obviously you need decent Internet so you can video conference and whatnot. But also the bandwidth between people is important, email is incredibly low bandwidth and the latency is high. Interactive text chat can help, voice chat is tricky because it requires more attention and you can’t fake paying attention (you can check email while doing a text chat, but less so while on an audio or video call).

## Zoom fatigue

I suspect a major aspect of Zoom fatigue is due to our intrinsic human need to read body language when we see someone, but most people have not great web cameras/bandwidth and on the receiving side is the monitor big enough? A laptop screen vs a 32” monitor are basically two totally different experiences. If possible get the best web camera you can, and make sure everyone has enough bandwidth for it and monitors to show it, and if not I suggest being aware of the problem and… trying to ignore it? I don’t know.

A peer reviewed paper was released (2021-02-23) [https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1](https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1) TL;DR:

1.  Excessive amounts of close-up eye contact is highly intense.
    
2.  Seeing yourself during video chats constantly in real-time is fatiguing.
    
3.  Video chats dramatically reduce our usual mobility.
    
4.  The cognitive load is much higher in video chats.
    

**So the obvious suggestions would be: sit back (60cm or more), hide the window showing yourself and consider disabling cameras and just using voice.**

# Problems in the system

Having things sit in inboxes or fall on the ground is a good indication you may have a problem or more likely a gap in your GTD system. Sometimes it’s as simple as “do we really need to do this? it hasn’t been done in 6 months…”. I love going through my projects and inboxes and deciding things like “we really don’t need to finish the basement, I can hit archive on these 14 projects”.

Just now I looked at my inbox (which is not at 0) and I realized I almost never start drafting an email and then leave it for later, I do an email all at once or not at all. Why? I don’t know. But I’ve started experimenting with replying to emails and leaving them unfinished for later. I suspect my problem is I need to get some of my thoughts down in writing, but still think about it, and drafting an email but not completing it gives me a perfect method to accomplish this. I’m going to experiment with draft emails and see how it goes.

# Conclusion

I hope this helps you. It helps me.
