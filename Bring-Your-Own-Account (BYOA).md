# Bring-Your-Own-Account (BYOA)

In general the CSA provides accounts for Google, Microsoft365, etc. However there are some situations and services where BYOA is more appropriate.

One common case is hardware devices like phones and tablets which require an account so that the App store and so on can be used.

# BYOA 

## Android devices / Google account

Android devices generally require a Google account to setup and log into the device and use the App store.

You can setup a CSA specific Google account to use (ideally your work account), but this means things like your personal messages may not work on the device. Also any apps purchased in your account will no longer be available when you leave the CSA.

In general we advise you to use your own Google account for activating and using the App store on your phone, tablet, laptop, etc.

## Apple devices / iCloud account

Apple devices (including CSA issued laptops) require an iCloud account to setup and log into the device and use the App store.

You can setup a CSA specific iCloud account to use, but this means things like your personal iMessage will not work on the device. Also any apps purchased in your account will no longer be available when you leave the CSA.

In general we advise you to use your own iCloud account for activating and using the App store on your phone, tablet, laptop, etc.

## GitHub

GitHub requires a GitHub account in order to interact with private repos, or to make changes/propose changes for repos.

You can setup a CSA specific GitHub ID to use, but since we use organizations and the repos are owned byt he organizations there is minimal risk when a user leaves of the CSA losing data. 

In general we advise you to use your own account for GitHub activity.

## Microsoft

Microsoft currently encourages but does not require a Microsoft account for your device (e.g. laptop/desktop).

You can setup a CSA specific Microsoft account to use (ideally your work account), but this means things like your personal messages may not work on the device. Also any apps purchased in your account will no longer be available when you leave the CSA.

In general we advise you to use your own Microsoft account for activating and using the App store on your laptop, desktop, etc.

## 1Password and other password managers

The CSA provides 1Password, the enterprise level includes a free family account. Please use the CSA 1Password for all CSA material, and if you wish you may use the provided family account for your personal stuff (the CSA has no access to it), additionally once you leave the CSA the famnily account will become read only (so you can continue to use it to log into things), and you can choose to pay the subscription fee if you want to fully use it.

If you already use a different password manager for your personal stuff you can safely ignore the 1Password family account.
