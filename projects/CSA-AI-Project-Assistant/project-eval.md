# Cloud Security Alliance AI Project Exploration Document

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cloud Security Alliance AI Project Exploration process. This document is designed to guide you through the planning and documentation of your AI project, ensuring that you consider all necessary aspects for a successful deployment.

## 1. Project Objectives
- **What do you hope to accomplish with AI?**
  - Automate existing tasks.
  - Enhance current operations.
  - Innovate by doing something entirely new with AI.

## 2. Intended Users
- **Who will be using the AI tool in your project?**
  - Internal CSA analysts.
  - External volunteers.
  - Other (please specify).
  
- **Will individuals or teams be using this tool?**
- **How will the tool be used?**
  - Interactively.
  - In batch processing style.
  - Live in meetings.
  - As a guidance and help tool.

- **Application Scope**
  - Is the AI tool intended for private internal or public use?

## 3. AI Output Considerations
- **What content or product will the AI produce?**
- **Does the content need to be labeled as AI-generated?**
- **Is the use of AI to generate or manipulate this content acceptable to the intended audience?**

## 4. Problem Space Exploration
Here we delve into the specifics of the problem you aim to solve or the process you wish to enhance with AI. Understanding the problem space is critical for identifying the most effective AI solutions.

## 5. AI Tool Evaluation
This section focuses on evaluating potential AI tools and technologies that could be utilized in your project. Considerations include the current CSA AI toolkit and other suitable tools and techniques that complement your project's needs.

## 6. Cost and Pricing Considerations
- **How are the costs of providing the AI tool managed?**
- **Is the pricing model linear, subscription-based, or otherwise?**
- **Do users pay for the tool, or is it provided for free?**
- **Consider the ongoing costs of these tools. Note that some solutions, like engineering a good prompt and publishing it, will essentially be free.**

## 7. Planning and Documentation
Guidance on planning your project's lifecycle, including financial sustainability and strategic management of AI tools. This section prompts you to think critically about how you will integrate and sustain AI technologies within your workflows.

## 8. Measuring Success and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **How will you measure the project's success?**
- **What KPIs will you use to validate the AI's output for accuracy and usefulness?**

## 9. End of Life for the AI Tool
- **Criteria for decommissioning the AI tool:**
  - Availability of new or better AI technologies.
  - Inadequate performance or utility.

## Conclusion
Thank you for completing the Project Exploration Document. This structured approach ensures that all aspects of your AI project are thoroughly considered, from initial problem space exploration to strategic management and sustainable use of AI tools, including their eventual decommissioning.
