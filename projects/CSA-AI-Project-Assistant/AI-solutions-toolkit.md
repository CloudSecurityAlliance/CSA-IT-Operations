## OpenAI My GPTs

**Capabilities:** These are RAG bots based on ChatGPT 4, the file ingest is limited: 20 files, each file can be up to 512 MB in size and can contain 2,000,000 tokens. No OCR, no abilitry to parse text columns e.g. do not upload a slide deck. Stick to plain text or markdown formatted text.

**Access requirements:** You must have a paid ChatGPT account to access a My GPTs bot

**Cost for the CSA to run:** none at this time

**Limitations:** There is no integration with Zapier for automated uploads of new or updated knowledge files

**Benefits:** Very quick and easy to build, costs the CSA nothing to run at this time

**Maintenance and Operational requirements:**  Very low, update the knowledge files as needed and update the instructions (system prompt) as needed.
